## Sequencing   
- Perform sequencing using the recommended scripts in MinKNOW for the kit/barcode combination of your choice   
- Enable live-basecalling to monitor read quality and translocation speed  
- Speed/Quality drops (maybe due to many short reads)? Refuel flow cells as recommended by ONT   
- After run: Wash flowcells and re-use with other barcode set, adjusted starting voltage to account for voltage drift
