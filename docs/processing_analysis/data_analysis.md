## Data analysis  
Here, you can find a description of the workflow using publicly available tools used to basecall, demultiplex, trim, map and count data. Additionally, we comment on custom Rscripts we used to perform the downstream analysis, including quality control, annotation of transcript boundaries, gene body coverage analysis and transcriptional unit annotation.
