## About this repository  
This is the repository for the manuscript "Insights into rRNA processing and modifications in Archaea using Nanopore-based RNA sequencing". 

The repository is currently actively developed.  

[![Active Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintenance%20Level-Actively%20Developed-brightgreen.svg)](https://gist.github.com/cheerfulstoic/d107229326a01ff0f333a1d3476e068d)

## Preprint  
This work is based on our previous preprint: 
[Exploring prokaryotic transcription, operon structures, rRNA maturation and modifications using Nanopore-based native RNA sequencing.]("https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.880849v2.full")  


## What can you find here  
A description of the workflow using publicly available tools used to basecall, demultiplex, trim and map (*direct cDNA*) data and data preparation for modified base detection (*using direct RNA*) can be found in the [pipeline](pipeline) section.   

Downstream analysis, including   
- quality control   
- detection of rRNA processing sites and classification of rRNA intermediates   
- Circular RNA detection    
- Modified base detection   
are based on custom Rscripts that are also described in the [pipeline](pipeline) section.  


## Data availability  
Raw direct RNA data (gzipped raw FAST5 files) have been uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and are available under project accession number [PRJNA632538](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=PRJNA632538) (WT run: SRR11991303, ∆KsgA run: SRR11991308).  
Direct cDNA data are available at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) under project accession number PRJEB57168.
